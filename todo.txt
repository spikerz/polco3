house rolls
----- -----
- we need to bring in a complete subset of rolls, legislators bills
- we need to exclude quroms


- page: "http://localhost:3001/rolls/50e87cd6d6f45fbc38000360", why:  AR		no votes
- don't show empty fields on rolls.show
- groups show: show group members and followers
- get abstains to show up
- remove pie charts, and replace with nicks stats
- why do all groups have no member count to them
- a user always needs to join the group they create

go through pdf's:
-----------------
- users show
 -- make sure we can still follow groups
- bills show
- rolls show

*- groups show
- get others working
 -- can't figure out how owner is assigned
 -- now missing groups we can follow
- rolls don't show if user is logged out

then nickification:
-------------------
- if you create a group, you should be following it by default
- groups are showing zero members ??

done:
- make user's commentable
- get nick's simple display to work for tallys (done)
- you voted on (empty)
- polco_group owner not working

not doing now:
--------------
> comment ratings
> can follow users
> user pictures
