- page: "http://localhost:3001/rolls/50e87cd6d6f45fbc38000360", why:  AR		no votes

- get nick's simple display to work for tallys
- can follow users?
- show group members and followers

- get others working

- if you create a group, you should be following it by default


- groups are showing zero members ??

done:
- make user's commentable


not doing now:
